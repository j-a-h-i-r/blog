I used ThymeLeaft for a bit during my first job. So, I decided to do it. The survey was on G2 and I got a $10 virtual card as a reward for participating.</p>\n<p>I was thinking of things where I could use this virtual card. It’s an international card, so I could use it in most of the sites I wanted to. The very first thing I did was to sign up for AWS 1 year free tier account. I also tried to sign up for GCP, but unfortunately they don’t support Virtual Cards.</p>\n<p>Buying a custom domain seemed to be the perfect thing for me. So, I headed on to GoDaddy and looked what’s available. After some digging, I settled for jahir.me. It was cheap, short and easy to remember. I got it for like 3$ for 1 year.</p>\n<p>This was the first time I was managing a domain and all the things seemed pretty complex. I still have to Google everytime I need to change a CNAME record. I found GoDaddy’s domain management interface pretty poorly designed so I moved my domain management to Cloudfare. Cloudflare’s interface feels quite intuitive to me. I also got free SSL which means https for my website for mee. Sweet deal!</p>\n<p>For future domains, I’ll probably buy it directly from Cloudflare or use Namecheap. These seem to be the better options with much friendlier tools.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, having a custom domain is pretty sweet. I host my site on GitHub. This blog is also hosted on GitHub. I have also configured an email server with Zoho for experimenting, and it was easy to set up. And all of this was done for about 3$. This feels like pretty good utility for the amount spent!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Buying a domain for the first time","date":"August 12, 2020","description":null}},"previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2-elastic-beanstalk-docker/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Using docker with elastic beanstalk is not fun!"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"655e0c18-07ad-56e0-8785-b9a53fdd41a0","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":"f612488c-12d6-5a98-8816-010229b27979"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","898691521"]}
