It uses express for the server and Angular on the front end. This is sort of a pet project and I like to do some experiments with it. One of them is to enable automatic deployment on it.</p>\n<p>The server and client codes resided on their own repo. What I did for deployment is to generate the build artifacts using angular on my local machine. Then I manually copied them over to my server repo and served the static files from there. This is very manual process and I needed to automate it.</p>\n<p>I used elastic beanstalk for automatically deploying my application. For the automating process, I converted my project into a monorepo, so that I can build the code upon push to master. While I was at it, I thought why not use docker.</p>\n<p>I created a docker environment on elastic beanstalk. I setup my Dockerfile and docker-compose configuration. It worked well for the first few times. But after that it was all just a mess. The biggest problem was that the environment kept crashing every time I deployed changes. And during the crash, I could not access the logs. It took almost 30 minutes each time the eb environment crashed. This makes the debugging process extremely frustating. After 2 days of trying to make it work, I gave up.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Using docker with elastic beanstalk is not fun!","date":"December 25, 2020","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/1-buying-domain/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Buying a domain for the first time"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/3-chrome-extension-iframe/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Running scripts inside externally loaded iframe from Chrome Extension"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"f612488c-12d6-5a98-8816-010229b27979","previousPostId":"655e0c18-07ad-56e0-8785-b9a53fdd41a0","nextPostId":"97cbcc47-ea42-5c85-8e01-81b04cc85a45"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"]}
